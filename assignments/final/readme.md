FIVE INTERCONNECTED ASPECTS: 
- Translate slider, as the value increases the canvas is translated to the right and sound is changed also based on the translateslider value
- Mouse click on bird plays bird sound
- Mouse click on crab makes health bar go down
- Mouse click on crab after death makes it move position
- Arrow Keys make person in Ocean Scene move (key press tied to velocity)
- Mouse click on each planet makes the planet play music and pulse, then click on them again to stop
- There are more but these are the first ones I thought of.

Which one do you tihnk produced the most interesting effect?
Maybe the translate slider, because it is tied to what you see and what you hear which makes the actualization of it kind of interesting. I also like the clicking planets because they pulse. Its cool to me.

MULTIMEDIA: 
- I used images for most of my animals and backgrounds to keep a consistent image style
- I used camera to put the user in the little rocketship (I thought it was cute)
- I used sound to make the music in each translated canvas
